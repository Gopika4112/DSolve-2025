## 💡 Project Idea  
Artificial Intelligence models, especially large-scale ones like ChatGPT, consume significant computational power and energy. A single AI-generated response can use **multiple times the energy of a standard Google search**, leading to a higher carbon footprint.  

Our **Chrome Extension** helps optimize AI interactions by **minimizing unnecessary energy consumption** while maintaining usability. By reducing redundant AI-generated responses and encouraging more efficient search habits, we promote a **more sustainable approach to AI usage**.  

## ✨ Key Features  
- 🔍 **Smart Redirection** – Suggests a Google search instead of ChatGPT when applicable, saving energy.  
- ✍️ **Response Length Limiter** – Asks users to specify a word limit, preventing excessive AI computation.  
- 🌍 **Carbon Footprint Display** – Shows the estimated carbon footprint of each AI query, raising awareness about energy consumption.
